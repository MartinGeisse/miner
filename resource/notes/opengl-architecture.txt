Frame skipping:
- replace queue -> GlWorkUnitAcceptor, with custom methods and special handling for add()
- method addFrameStart(), addFrameEnd(); queued frame count == number of queued frame starts
- method addSideEffectRegionStart(),. addSideEffectRegionEnd() == important region that cannot be skipped
	(such as VBO creation commands)
- setFrameSkipThreshold() --> low-level threshold; worker thread starts skipping frames ==
	skips between start frame event and end frame event, except important regions
- getQueuedFrameCount() --> too high (queued frame count > high-level threshold > low-level threshold) ==
	jammed, high-level render thread should skip frames too (adaptive!) [version 2]

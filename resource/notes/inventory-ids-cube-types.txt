Original question: Should inventory slots have separate IDs or should they be identified by CubeType?

Items can be much more complex than a simple CubeType: Damage/wear, material purity, manufactirung quality, ...
- or can they? This is a question of game design and I don't know how it will be answered.

But if items are that complex, cubes must be too since an item can be placed in the world as a cube (and we don't want
item properties to change by placing and picking up).

Alternatively, "small" items can be treated differently than cubes.

"small items" (and also cubes if they can be complex) must be identified by a separate ID then. The client cannot just
list all properties because some may be unknown yet, and listing all known properties may be ambiguous. Listing
properties also makes the code very complex and the network messages large.

BUT: If even cubes become complex, it may be useful to remove item stacks altogether, at least in game logic (the
client may *display* a set of items as a stack, and then it is a decision made in the client whether to stack items
with slightly different properties.)

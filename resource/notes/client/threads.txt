TODO incomplete, esp. with respect to section loading and also WRT using worker threads

The client uses the following threads:

Game thread: Runs both game logic and high-level drawing operations

OpenGL worker thread: Receives work units from the game thread and executes them. This thread is the only one calling
OpenGL functions.

Netty threads: React to incoming network messages. TODO document the interaction with other threads, as soon as
it is well-defined.

---

Startup: To make sure that OpenGL calls work as expected, the initial thread -- the one that calls the main() method --
becomes the OpenGL worker thread. The game thread is started by that thread manually; Netty worker threads are
started implicitly by Netty. Worker threads are created by the task system using a thread pool executor.
